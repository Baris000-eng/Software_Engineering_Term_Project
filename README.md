# COMP-302 FALL-2021 SOFTWARE ENGINEERING CLASS, NEED FOR SPEAR PROJECT

Need For Spear Term Project for COMP302-Software Engineering class. (Including weekly agendas, tutorials benefitted from, larman book chapter pdfs, and reports prepared in an agile and iterative approach).

TEST_1, TEST_2, TEST_3, TEST_4 (INDIVIDUAL TEST DONE BY EACH TEAM MEMBER BY USING JUNIT)

GROUP_TEST (TEST DONE AS A GROUP FOR PLAYER.JAVA CLASS, JAVA JUNIT IS USED)


PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE AND TOOLS USED:

1-) PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE: JAVA 

2-) DATABASE: POSTGRESQL

3-) FOR TESTING: JAVA JUNIT

4-) For UI (User Interface): Java Swing


Note: Along with the applications of the design patterns, postgresql, and Java JUNIT, I have learned some extra and fancy stuff such as adjusting 
the sound amount with jslider (which can be frequently seen in computer games) and adjusting the screen brightness level with JSlider.

COMP302-SYLLABUS: 

Review of methods and tools used in software development. Object oriented design and open software architectures. Requirements analysis, design, implementation, testing, maintenance and management. Engineering applications.
This course assumes that you are familiar with object-oriented programming using Java. If you feel you have weaknesses in this area, for instance, if you scored a C or below in Comp 132 or Comp202,  the first few weeks of the course are a good time to brush up on your skills. The class will build upon knowledge of these fundamentals and will emphasize object-oriented analysis and design, and good programming discipline.  A software development project to be carried out in groups forms the backbone of the course. We will see a software product through the project lifecycle, from analyzing customers’ requirements to design, modeling, implementation, and testing. We will have design reviews for each major phase of your project. There will be regular meetings with each project group and a final presentation for your product at the end of the semester. 
COURSE LEARNİNG OUTCOMES
Develop an understanding of  the key concerns and challenges of engineering a large software system.
Develop an understanding the issues of requirements, specifying, architecting, designing, and testing a software system in order to provide modularity, adaptability and maintainability.
Analyze, design, and develop software using object-oriented analysis and design, and design patterns.
Develop the teamwork management skills.
OTHER
Required textbook:
Applying UML and Patterns, Edition: 3E, Larman Pearson Education.

Grading Policies
Assessment: (Tentative, there could upto -+5 changes depending on the pandemic and remote teaching conditions).
Class Participation %3 //       %2 code review, %1 demo day.
Midterms %15+15
Group Project %67
Class Participation: Attendance will be taken for both in-class students and online stduntes. Some of the project discussions will be conducted in the class as well. You are expected to attend classes (physical or remote) at least 70% to get full points. There will be no makeup for missed attendances beyond that. 70% 3 points, 60% 2 points, 50% 1 points,, less than 50% 0 points.  Updated due to hybrid system.
2 points bonus for in class discussions (subject to the instructor's evalution of class participation, useful participation in discussion forums...).
The participation in interactive discussions during the class/online meetings might be used also for student participation evaluation.
We will be using Discussion Board  for anything related to the course. Subscribe to the discussion forums to be notified  with email if someone posts or responds. DO NOT send email, answering emails  in a timely manner is not guaranteed. 
Midterms:  There will be  two midterms. The midterms are  closed-book exam and will be conducted face-to-face. There will be only one makeup exam during the last week of the semester for those who missed a midterm due to health reasons (report is required).It wil replace the missed ones. The format of the makeup exam will be given at least one week before the exam - not necessarily in the same format as the midterms.
Final: There is no final exam in this course. It is a project based course.
Project organization and grading:
You are required to  form project groups of size GROUP_SIZE. GROUP_SIZE is  FIVE  students (only a few of four or six class size is not multiple of five).
If you are not part of a team by the third week of the semester, you will be put in a team randomly. 
Similarly, if you form of a team of size less than GROUP_SIZE, you will get new members (chosen randomly).
During the semester, if some of your team members drop the course, the remaining members are still responsible for the work, no compensation will be given. Choose your team wisely. 
If the class size is not multiple of GROUP_SIZE, some groups might have +/-1 members (randomly assigned if no team volunteers). 
Group members are expected to take part in every aspect of the project, and your grade for each phase will be based on your contribution to the group’s work. If you fail the group project (i.e. score less than 60 out of 100 points), you will fail the class regardless of your grades on the midterm.
The project requires the students to work together in a team from the beginning to the end. You should plan on committing your time and effort to the team work. Teams that do not work together but individually produce very poor results and score poorly! Teamwork, teamwork, teamwork! Keep this in mind. Make sure that you perform well in your team. The peer evaluations submitted by your peers will affect your project scores. The details of peer evaluation will be announced during  the project.
The weekly meetings will be graded based on the group work and individual contribution.The objection to weekly meeting grades must be done within a week after the grade is announced. No objections will be considered after that. 
Teams or team members should report to the instructor as soon as possible if there are problems in the team that will affect teamwork. 
The health report should be more than one week to be counted as an excuse for  the project weekly participation. Maximum TWO meetings will be excused for health reports. 
Weekly Project Meeting Schedule: We will have around 10 meetings. Each meeting will be conducted with  preferably online  involving all the group members and the TA. The meeting time will be scheduled so that every group member and the TA can meet at the same time. We try to schedule the meetings towards the end of the week. The meeting time does not have to be during lab hours.  If no time can be found that fits all, it has to be during the lab time.
We will schedule online meetings/breakout rooms for each group and the TA.
Your project will have intermediate milestones with corresponding deadlines. Work submitted late will receive no credit. This is a strict policy. If you can’t complete the work by the deadline, reduce the scope of the work you have to do. You have to submit a coherent set of documents and/or software by the deadline even if it fulfills only part of the requirements for the deadline.
Further details of project administration, schedule and deadlines will be announced after the class roster is finalized.
Tool tutorials: Throughout the semester, you will need to use on software engineering and project management tools such as UML modeling tools, version management tools (GIT) and testing tools such as JUnit. Links to material on these tools will be available on the course web site. Please familiarize yourself with these tools as soon as possible.
Note: the grading weights midterms and the project is tentative, may change slighly depending on their relative difficulties.
